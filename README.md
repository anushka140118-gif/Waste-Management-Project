# Waste-Management-Project
This project uses Googleâ€™s Teachable Machine to build a simple yet effective image classification model that can distinguish between biodegradable (bio) and non-biodegradable (non-bio) waste. The model takes test images from the user or a real time image of the waste via the webcam and uses Computer Vision to distinguish between Biodegradable and non-Biodegradable wastes.
This project aims to promote awareness on waste segregation.
